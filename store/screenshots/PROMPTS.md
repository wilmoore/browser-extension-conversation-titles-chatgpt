## Prompt 1: Hero Screenshot (Main Value Prop)

> A clean, modern browser screenshot mockup showing ChatGPT interface. At the bottom of the chat area, there's a subtle but visible conversation title "Planning Q4 Marketing Strategy" displayed in a sleek footer bar. A cursor hovers over the title with a tooltip showing "Click to copy". Minimal, professional design with soft shadows. Light mode interface. 16:10 aspect ratio.

**Focus**: Show the title is always visible, clickable

---

## Prompt 2: Copy Formats Feature

> An infographic-style image showing 4 different clipboard outputs from clicking a conversation title. Each shows a different format: (1) Just title "My Conversation", (2) Title + URL as markdown link, (3) Title with project prefix "[Project] Title", (4) Full context with all metadata. Clean icons representing each format. Modern flat design, blue accent colors. 16:10 aspect ratio.

**Focus**: Show the flexibility of copy formats

---

## Prompt 3: Workflow Integration

> Split-screen comparison: Left side shows ChatGPT with a conversation title visible in footer. Right side shows the same title pasted into a notes app, Notion page, or Slack message. Arrows connect them showing the copy-paste flow. Clean, minimal design emphasizing productivity. 16:10 aspect ratio.

**Focus**: Show real-world use case

---

## Prompt 4: Before/After Comparison

> Before: ChatGPT interface with conversation title hidden/scrolled away, user looking confused at generic "ChatGPT" tab. After: Same interface with visible title bar showing "Code Review: Auth Module" in the footer, user confidently navigating. Split or side-by-side layout. 16:10 aspect ratio.

**Focus**: Pain point → solution

---

## Prompt 5: Keyboard Shortcuts

> Elegant visualization of keyboard shortcuts: regular click, Shift+click, Ctrl+click, Ctrl+Shift+click - each mapping to a different copy format. Keyboard key icons with arrows pointing to output examples. Dark background with glowing key highlights. Modern, developer-friendly aesthetic. 16:10 aspect ratio.

**Focus**: Power user features

---

## Style Notes

- **Avoid**: Cluttered designs, too much text, low contrast
- **Prefer**: Clean whitespace, clear visual hierarchy, professional look
- **Colors**: Match ChatGPT's green/dark theme or use neutral modern palette
- **Typography**: Sans-serif, readable at thumbnail size

## After Generation

1. Review outputs for clarity at thumbnail size
2. Add annotations/callouts if needed (in design tool)
3. Ensure text is readable
4. Test that key value prop is visible in first screenshot
